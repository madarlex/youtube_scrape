        "Description": "Previous Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIm2W9TtzR0\nCode Used:\nhttps://github.com/analyticswithadam/Python/blob/main/YouTube_Comments_Advanced.ipynb\n\nIn this video I will show you how to scape all comments from a youtube video as well as how to scape all youtube comments from multiple videos. With the twitter API deactivated the YouTube API is a perfect place to get data for sentiment analysis. The issue before what that the number of comments was limited to 100 but with the next page token and a while loop we can pull all comments from multiple youtube videos which gives us enough data to perform sentiment analysis.",
